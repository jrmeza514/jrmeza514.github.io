								&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to (our textbook), only 23% of American energy stems from  Coal; however, we do have high reserves of it. A 2008 statistic reports that America used 1,121,714 short tons of coal; we ranked 2nd behind China in having used the most.
							</p>
							<p>
								&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Burning excessive amounts of coal has proven to be highly detrimental to the atmosphere, and can be attributed to Acid Rain. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, two common components of coal, "sulfur and nitrogen, are primarily responsible for the harmful effects of Acid Rain." 
							</p>
							<p>
								&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"When these are burned in power plants and industrial boilers, the sulfur combines with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO2). Because SO2 does not react with most chemicals found in the atmosphere, it can travel long distances. Eventually, if it comes in contact with ozone or hydrogen peroxide, it can be converted to sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide can dissolve in water, forming a dilute solution of sulfuric acid."
							</p>
							<p>
								&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The process that the sulfur and nitrogen go through to produce toxicity in rainfall is explained in this excerpt taken from the official EPA website. The Acid Rain will travel, condensed, in clouds wherever the wind takes it, and then disperse in showers over cities and fields, damaging crops and eroding buildings. 
							</p>
							<p>
								&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The health risks that stem from the consequences of coal burning have become more apparent as the years have progressed: Black Lung, for instance, which affects coal miners and those who work near coal too often. Heavy pollution, and the abused atmosphere are responsible for weakening air quality and, arguably, global warming. 

							</p>
							<p>
								&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recently, environmental activists have been pushing for the US to wane from their coal dependence, and the government is moving toward fuels that are less detrimental to our atmospheric environment.

							Shale

							<p>
							&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Shale and oil and gas are acknowledged to exist in abundance along the American East Coast, as well as the Mid-West, and into Canada. More reserves, or 'plays' can also be found in parts of every continent, with notable concentrations in China and South America (Argentina). 
							</p>
							<p>
							&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Those who support the continued cultivation of Shale as a main energy source contend that Shale is cleaner than burning Coal, and compare that the cultivation of shale through fracking has helped bolster local economies without the effects of Black Lung. 
							</p>
							<p>
							&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Hydraulic fracturing is a critical component of shale collection. 'Fracking' is widely controversial because many fear that the chemicals used to break through the Shale stone will contaminate the surrounding soil, and sully our water supplies. Increases in seismic activity have been linked to fracking, and the forced movement of the sheet rock. In most countries Fracking is regulated, if not banned. 
							</p>
							<p>
							&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Some American environmentalists argue,however, that the law is too lenient in regards to fracking. 
							</p>
							<p>
							&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 contained a provision that has come to be known as the "Halliburton Loophole," an exemption for gas drilling and extraction from requirements in the underground injection control (UIC) program of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).  Other exemptions are also present in the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act." (Fracking: Laws and Loopholes; Clean Water Action) Conveys the dismay that the environmentalists have for the weak regard that the Government has for the ongoing health of their environment.

							<p> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This alternative energy option is one that probably won't result in the draining of precious finite resources, nor does it emit toxic chemicals into our atmosphere. Instead, it takes energy from Sunlight, and uses a panel to convert the rays into energy that we can use. Solar panels are comprised of considerably expensive materials, and require an initial investment on behalf of the user. The panels pay themselves off by saving on what the user would have otherwise spent on crude energy. SETO (Solar Energy Technologies Office)  is working to build Solar and other renewable Energy options to the point where it can compete with coal and petroleum's affordability. Otherwise known as the 'Sunshot Initiative', SETO's plan revolves around heavy research and innovation that would make it as easy, if not easier, for consumers to pay for energy that is better for their ecosystem. 
</p>
                             <p>
                                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; With the Sunshot Initiative, SETO has funded and driven more than 350 solar research projects. SETO is a branch of the DOE (US Department of Energy), from whom it receives support.

							<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As it's name implies, Geothermal energy is taken from heat within the earth. the nation utilize stores of GeoThermal energy most notably in Alaska and Hawaii, where steam is often used to power turbines and generators.  </p>
							<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The GTO (GeoThermal Technologies Office) is another branch of the DOE that is conducting research in regards to improving the efficiency of GeoThermal Energy. </p>

                                &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to the Renewable Energy World website; 
"A geothermal heat pump system consists of a heat pump, an air delivery system (ductwork), and a heat exchanger-a system of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the building. In the winter, the heat pump removes heat from the heat exchanger and pumps it into the indoor air delivery system. In the summer, the process is reversed, and the heat pump moves heat from the indoor air into the heat exchanger." (GeoThermal Energy, Renewable Energy World)

						<div class="SourceDescription">
							<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to the EERE (Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy) hydroelectric energy is considered to be the Nation's largest renewable resource, having already saved US from 200 million metric tons of Carbon Emission per year. Marine and Hydrokinetic Energy utilize the movement of tidal currents with technology that does not damage the ecosystem as directly as Coal and Oil would.  </p>
                            <p>
                               &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; However,  researchers continue to improve Hydrokinetic technology so that it is efficient enough to brace the tempestuity of the ocean, and will not emit or leak material debris into the sea.   It is the goal of the Water Power Program for Hydroelectric energy to support 15% of the nation's electricity by 2030.

							Man Power

						<div class="SourceDescription">
							<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Antiquity has proven the effectiveness of man-power, in the building of the Pyramids, for example. Their technology was minimal, but the exertion that Men were forced to use on construction would exhaust their ability to continue the world into chaos. In their endless pursuit of action, knowledge, and productivity; men are merely seeking that procreative pragmatism that women are naturally gifted with. Because Men are deprived of truly experiencing the Creation of Life, they can only hope to compensate.</p>
							<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Men, from culture to culture, have varying methods of coping with their genetic inadequacies. In the polytheistic Greco Roman mythology, the ruling god is always male. However,  the pantheon still acknowledges that Women are the main supporter for the continuation of life, as the goddess of Earth, herself, is a woman. there are various other male fertility deities, but all exist upon the land made of Woman, all are nurtured by Women, and they all represent a thirst for the comforts that women have to offer. Pan, for example, and other gods chase relentlessly after Women, demonstrating the craving that men have for women, and the lengths that men go to because they cannot live without Women.</p>
							<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Disarming and redirecting an Androcentric work-force would draw men from further damaging peaceful Gaia, and keep them from treating her like a battleground to destroy. Unlike most natural resources, Men are most detrimental to the environment when left alone. If their masculine-menial responsibilities aren't the point of their focus, their primal urges will continue to be otherwise expressed through rape, war, or other such primitive behaviors. Men must be encouraged to channel their imbecilic instincts in a manner less inimical to our environment. </p>
							<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They need to be put to work. </p>
							<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Men are the most renewable of resources. They, as are all human beings, desirous of productivity, and thrive in environments.</p>
