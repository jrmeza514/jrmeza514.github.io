							Coal
						</div>
						<div class="SourceDescription">
							<p>
								According to (our textbook), only 23% of American energy stems from  Coal; however, we do have high reserves of it. A 2008 statistic reports that America used 1,121,714 short tons of coal; we ranked 2nd behind China in having used the most.
							</p>
							<p>
								Burning excessive amounts of coal has proven to be highly detrimental to the atmosphere, and can be attributed to Acid Rain. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, two common components of coal, “sulfur and nitrogen, are primarily responsible for the harmful effects of Acid Rain.” 
							</p>
							<p>
								“When these are burned in power plants and industrial boilers, the sulfur combines with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO2). Because SO2 does not react with most chemicals found in the atmosphere, it can travel long distances. Eventually, if it comes in contact with ozone or hydrogen peroxide, it can be converted to sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide can dissolve in water, forming a dilute solution of sulfuric acid.”
							</p>
							<p>
								The process that the sulfur and nitrogen go through to produce toxicity in rainfall is explained in this excerpt taken from the official EPA website. The Acid Rain will travel, condensed, in clouds wherever the wind takes it, and then disperse in showers over cities and fields, damaging crops and eroding buildings. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The health risks that stem from the consequences of coal burning have become more apparent as the years have progressed: Black Lung, for instance, which affects coal miners and those who work near coal too often. Heavy pollution, and the abused atmosphere are responsible for weakening air quality and, arguably, global warming. 

							</p>
							<p>
								Recently, environmental activists have been pushing for the US to wane from their coal dependence, and the government is moving toward fuels that are less detrimental to our atmospheric environment.

							Shale
						</div>
						<div class="SourceDescription">
							<p>
								Shale and oil and gas are acknowledged to exist in abundance along the American East Coast, as well as the Mid-West, and into Canada. More reserves, or ‘plays’ can also be found in parts of every continent, with notable concentrations in China and South America (Argentina). 
							</p>
							<p>
								Those who support the continued cultivation of Shale as a main energy source contend that Shale is cleaner than burning Coal, and compare that the cultivation of shale through fracking has helped bolster local economies without the effects of Black Lung. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Hydraulic fracturing is a critical component of shale collection. ‘Fracking’ is widely controversial because many fear that the chemicals used to break through the Shale stone will contaminate the surrounding soil, and sully our water supplies. Increases in seismic activity have been linked to fracking, and the forced movement of the sheet rock. In most countries Fracking is regulated, if not banned. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Some American environmentalists argue,however, that the law is too lenient in regards to fracking. 
							</p>
							<p>
								“The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 contained a provision that has come to be known as the "Halliburton Loophole," an exemption for gas drilling and extraction from requirements in the underground injection control (UIC) program of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).  Other exemptions are also present in the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.” (Fracking: Laws and Loopholes; Clean Water Action) Conveys the dismay that the environmentalists have for the weak regard that the Government has for the ongoing health of their environment.

							Solar Energy
						</div>
						<div class="SourceDescription">
							<p>This alternative energy option is one that probably won’t result in the draining of precious finite resources, nor does it emit toxic chemicals into our atmosphere. Instead, it takes energy from Sunlight, and uses a panel to convert the rays into energy that we can use. Solar panels are comprised of considerably expensive materials, and require an initial investment on behalf of the user. The panels pay themselves off by saving on what the user would have otherwise spent on crude energy. </p>

							GeoThermal Energy
						</div>
						<div class="SourceDescription">
							<p>As it’s name implies, Geothermal energy is taken from heat within the earth. We utilize stores of GeoThermal energy most notably in Alaska and Hawaii, where steam is oft used to power turbines and generators.  </p>
							<p>“A geothermal heat pump system consists of a heat pump, an air delivery system (ductwork), and a heat exchanger-a system of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the building. In the winter, the heat pump removes heat from the heat exchanger and pumps it into the indoor air delivery system. In the summer, the process is reversed, and the heat pump moves heat from the indoor air into the heat exchanger.” </p>

							Hydroelectric Power
						</div>
						<div class="SourceDescription">
							<p>The modern hydroelectric power plants fallback on old WaterMill technology. Flowing water would turn a wheel, and the wheel would keep the grainery moving without manual labor. The larger scale plants have entire dams built to keep turbines moving, in place of wooden grain-wheels. </p>
