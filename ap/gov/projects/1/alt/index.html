								According to (our textbook), only 23% of American energy stems from  Coal; however, we do have high reserves of it. A 2008 statistic reports that America used 1,121,714 short tons of coal; we ranked 2nd behind China in having used the most.
							</p>
							<p>
								Burning excessive amounts of coal has proven to be highly detrimental to the atmosphere, and can be attributed to Acid Rain. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, two common components of coal, “sulfur and nitrogen, are primarily responsible for the harmful effects of Acid Rain.” 
							</p>
							<p>
								“When these are burned in power plants and industrial boilers, the sulfur combines with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO2). Because SO2 does not react with most chemicals found in the atmosphere, it can travel long distances. Eventually, if it comes in contact with ozone or hydrogen peroxide, it can be converted to sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide can dissolve in water, forming a dilute solution of sulfuric acid.”
							</p>
							<p>
								The process that the sulfur and nitrogen go through to produce toxicity in rainfall is explained in this excerpt taken from the official EPA website. The Acid Rain will travel, condensed, in clouds wherever the wind takes it, and then disperse in showers over cities and fields, damaging crops and eroding buildings. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The health risks that stem from the consequences of coal burning have become more apparent as the years have progressed: Black Lung, for instance, which affects coal miners and those who work near coal too often. Heavy pollution, and the abused atmosphere are responsible for weakening air quality and, arguably, global warming. 

							</p>
							<p>
								Recently, environmental activists have been pushing for the US to wane from their coal dependence, and the government is moving toward fuels that are less detrimental to our atmospheric environment.
